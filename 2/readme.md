#### 2. Describe the runtime difference(s) between `for await (const a  of [p1, p2, p3]) { ... }` vs `[p1, p2, p3].forEach(async (p) {  await p })`

The first example will wait for each promise to resolve synchronously. `a` will hold the value of each resolved promise. The second example will resolve all promises concurrently due to async not being supported with `Array.forEach`. So at no where in the loop will a blocking like behaviour happen to wait for the results.
